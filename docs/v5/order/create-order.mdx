- **Supported order type (`orderType`):**<br/>
Limit order: `orderType`=_Limit_, it is necessary to specify order qty and price.<br/>
<a href="https://www.abfinance.com/en/help-center/article/Types-of-Orders-Available-on-Bybit">Market order</a>: <code>orderType</code>=<i>Market</i>, execute at the best price in the Bybit market until the transaction is completed. When selecting a market order, the "price" can be empty. In the futures trading system, in order to protect traders against the serious slippage of the Market order, Bybit trading engine will convert the market order into an IOC limit order for matching. If there are no orderbook entries within price slippage limit, the order will not be executed. If there is insufficient liquidity, the order will be cancelled. The slippage threshold refers to the percentage that the order price deviates from the mark price. You can learn more here: <a href="https://announcements.abfinance.com/en/article/adjustments-to-bybit-s-derivative-trading-limit-order-mechanism-blt469228de1902fff6/">Adjustments to Bybit's Derivative Trading Price Limit Mechanism</a>

- **Supported timeInForce strategy:**<br/>
`GTC`<br/>
`IOC`<br/>
`FOK`<br/>
`PostOnly`: If the order would be filled immediately when submitted, it will be **cancelled**. The purpose of this is to protect your order during the submission process. If the matching system cannot entrust the order to the order book due to price changes on the market, it will be cancelled.<br/>
`RPI`: Retail Price Improvement order. Assigned market maker can place this kind of order, and it is a post only order, only match with the order from Web or APP.

- **How to create a conditional order:**<br/>
When submitting an order, if `triggerPrice` is set, the order will be automatically converted into a conditional order. In addition, the conditional order does not occupy the margin. If the margin is insufficient after the conditional order is triggered, the order will be cancelled.

- **<a href="https://www.abfinance.com/en/help-center/article/Introduction-to-Take-Profit-Stop-Loss-Perpetual-Futures-Contracts">Take profit / Stop loss</a>**: You can set TP/SL while placing orders. Besides, you could modify the position's TP/SL.

- **Order quantity**: The quantity of perpetual contracts you are going to buy/sell. For the order quantity, Bybit only supports positive number at present.

- **Order price**: Place a limit order, this parameter is **required**. If you have position, the price should be higher than the _liquidation price_.
For the minimum unit of the price change, please refer to the `priceFilter` > `tickSize` field in the [instruments-info](../market/instrument#) endpoint.

- **orderLinkId**: You can customize the active order ID. We can link this ID to the order ID in the system. Once the
active order is successfully created, we will send the unique order ID in the system to you. Then, you can use this order
ID to cancel active orders, and if both orderId and orderLinkId are entered in the parameter input, Bybit will prioritize the orderId to process the corresponding order. Meanwhile, your customized order ID should be no longer than 36 characters and should be **unique**.

- **Open orders up limit:**<br/>
**Spot:** 500 orders in total, including a maximum of 30 open TP/SL orders, a maximum of 30 open conditional orders for each symbol per account<br/>

- **Rate limit:**<br/>
Please refer to [rate limit table](../rate-limit#trade). If you need to raise the rate limit, please contact your client manager or submit an application via <a href="https://www.abfinance.com/future-activity/en-US/institutional-services">here</a>

When the total number of orders of a single user (aggregated the number of orders across main account and subaccounts) within a day (UTC 0 - UTC 24) exceeds a certain upper limit, the platform will reserve the right to remind, warn, and impose necessary restrictions.
